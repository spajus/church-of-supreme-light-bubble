# Church of Supreme Light Bubble

Church of Supreme Light Bubble is an open source religion, which is fully
compatible with modern science. It explains what happened before The Big Bang,
and accepts that the rest was taken care of by laws of physics.

## Why do we need religion, when we have science?

Good question!

Because having faith is beneficial to human psychology. Believing in a higher
power that governs everything gives us mental leverage to handle difficult
things in life.

## How is Church of Supreme Light Bubble different?

1. It's open source. Anyone can contribute and edit the ideas expressed by this religion.
2. It doesn't claim anything that is against scientific facts.
3. It is compatible with people who cannot believe in any popular religion.
4. It does not have saints, religious figures, priests, popes, or any hierarchy whatsoever.
5. It doesn't depend on donations.

## What does the religion say?

In the beginning there was The Big Bang, which spawned the known Universe.
The Big Bang was produced by Supreme Light Bubble, which contracted into an
infinitely dense spot, that later expanded into the world we live in today.

## For how long did Supreme Light Bubble exist before The Big Bang?

Time was not a concept back then, so there cannot be an answer. Time starts
with 0, when Supreme Light Bubble triggered The Big Bang. Before that
there was nothing but the Supreme Light Bubble itself, without time.

## Does Supreme Light Bubble still exist?

No. It sacrificed itself to start The Universe. Supreme Light Bubble does not
exist anymore; that's why there is no evidence of it anywhere.

## How can you prove Supreme Light Bubble existed?

There is no proof, because nobody figured out what really happened before The
Big Bang. But it cannot be disproven either.

## Can you pray to Supreme Light Bubble?

Yes, you can.

## Will Supreme Light Bubble hear my prayers?

It will not, because it doesn't exist anymore.

## What is the point of praying to Supreme Light Bubble then?

Because praying helps you relax mentally, and to better visualize and
express the things that are concerning you. Think of it as meditation.

## How do I pray to Supreme Light Bubble?

It's up to you. You can picture it in your mind as a bubble of light, and spill
your heart's contents to it. You can ask for guidance, support or forgiveness.
You can hash problems out with it (recognizing, of course, that you are working
things out for yourself, and Supreme Light Bubble is acting as an internalized,
idealized foil).

Your mind is the limit.

## Is there a hand sign for Supreme Light Bubble?

Yes, there is. You have to put your fingers in a circle and hold it in front of
you, like this:

## Is there Heaven or Hell in this religion?

You become one with Supreme Light Bubble, for eternity.
